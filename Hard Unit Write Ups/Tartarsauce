Box: Tartarsauce
Difficulty: Hard
OS: Linux

Recon:
- Full nmap scan revealed ports 21 (FTP), 25 (SMTP), 80 (HTTP).
- FTP allowed anonymous but looked empty at first.
- Tried brute forcing hidden dirs on web server → found /wordpress with old version running.

Enumeration:
- FTP actually had hidden files (.backup) after enabling -a flag.
- Found credentials stored in backup configs.
- Reused creds for WordPress login.

Exploitation:
- Outdated WordPress plugin vulnerable to RCE.
- Uploaded PHP shell disguised as plugin → webshell worked.
- Reverse shell gained as www-data.
- Enumerated /home → multiple users with restricted permissions.
- Used backup configs again to pivot into one of the users (password reuse).

Privilege Escalation:
- Kernel privesc possible: Linux kernel was old and vulnerable to DirtyCOW (CVE-2016-5195).
- Compiled exploit locally, got root.
- Alternative vector I noticed: misconfigured SUID binary in /usr/local/bin could have been abused as well.

Notes:
- Took me a while to realize FTP had hidden content.
- WordPress plugin enumeration was the big break.
- Multiple rabbit holes in SMTP enumeration that led nowhere.

Mitigations:
- Patch WordPress and plugins.
- Remove sensitive files from FTP (no hidden configs).
- Update kernel to mitigate DirtyCOW.
