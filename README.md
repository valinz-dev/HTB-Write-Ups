## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used
Enumeration
General:

nmap – Port scanning and service version detection

rustscan – Fast port scanner, often used before nmap

netcat / nc – Banner grabbing, basic connections

ping, traceroute, whois, dig – Network reconnaissance

Web Enumeration:

dirb, gobuster, ffuf – Directory and file brute-forcing

nikto – Web vulnerability scanner

whatweb, wappalyzer – Identify technologies

curl, wget – Interact with endpoints manually

SMB / Windows-Specific:

enum4linux, enum4linux-ng – Enumerate SMB shares, users

smbclient, rpcclient, crackmapexec – Access and query SMB services

nmap --script smb* – SMB-related NSE scripts

bloodhound, SharpHound – Active Directory enumeration

Linux-Specific:

pspy, lsof, netstat – Monitor running processes and ports

Manual checks in /proc, cron, .bash_history

Exploitation
Web Applications:

Burp Suite – Intercept and modify HTTP traffic

SQLMap – Automated SQL injection

wfuzz, hydra – Credential brute-forcing

XSStrike, XSSer – XSS vulnerability testing

Shells and Payloads:

msfconsole – Metasploit Framework

msfvenom – Generate payloads

Manual command injection (;, &&, |, backticks)

File Upload / LFI / RFI Techniques:

Bypassing filters, exploiting vulnerable uploaders

Local/Remote File Inclusion testing

Privilege Escalation
Linux:

linPEAS, linux-smart-enumeration, LES – Automated enumeration

sudo -l – Check for sudo permissions

GTFOBins – Known privilege escalation paths

Check for SUID binaries: find / -perm -4000

Misconfigured cron jobs, writable /etc/passwd, exposed credentials

Windows:

winPEAS, PowerUp.ps1, Seatbelt.exe – Privilege enumeration

whoami /priv, icacls, accesschk.exe – Privilege analysis

Dump registry hives: SAM, SYSTEM, SECURITY

Exploitable configurations: AlwaysInstallElevated, unquoted service paths, weak ACLs

Post-Exploitation
Access & Shell Management:

netcat – Reverse/bind shell, tunneling

bash, python, perl, php – Web shell scripting

powershell – Advanced scripting and system interaction

Persistence Techniques:

SSH key injection

Scheduled tasks, cron jobs

Startup folder or Run key abuse

Credential and Data Collection:

Extract browser data, saved passwords, tokens

mimikatz, lsass dump

Credential reuse, token harvesting

Additional Tools & Techniques
evil-winrm – WinRM shell for Windows

impacket suite – Tools like secretsdump.py, psexec.py, wmiexec.py

responder, mitm6 – LLMNR/NBT-NS spoofing and poisoning

chisel, ngrok, ssh -R – Pivoting and tunneling
